# Hotel Management System

## Project Description

The Hotel Management System is a desktop application developed in Java that facilitates efficient management of hotel operations, catering to both administrators and clients. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing various aspects of hotel operations, including room management, reservation handling, and user authentication.

## Key Features

### Administrator Functionality:

- **Manage Rooms:** Create, modify, and delete rooms to maintain an up-to-date inventory.
- **Manage Reservations:** View reservation requests, accept or decline reservations, and handle reservation modifications or cancellations.
- **User Authentication:** Ensure secure access to the application by requiring users to authenticate before accessing administrative functions.

### Client Functionality:

- **Room Reservation:** Allow clients to request room reservations, specifying check-in and check-out dates, room type preferences, etc.
- **Reservation Management:** Enable clients to view and modify their existing reservations, as well as cancel reservations within the specified timeframe.
- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to ensure that clients have secure access to their reservation-related functionalities.

## Architecture

The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to achieve a clear separation of concerns and enhance maintainability. The Model layer encapsulates the data and business logic, the View layer presents the user interface elements, and the Controller layer coordinates user actions and updates to the model and view.

## Data Storage

Data is stored in MongoDB to maintain persistence within the application session. Additionally, the application supports data persistence between sessions through MongoDB, allowing users to resume their activities seamlessly.

## Exception Handling

The system includes robust exception handling mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and prevent unexpected errors. Various scenarios, such as attempting to modify a room already reserved or canceling a reservation beyond the allowable timeframe, are handled gracefully to provide a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** Core programming language for application development.
- **Swing:** GUI toolkit used for creating the desktop user interface.
- **MVC Architecture:** Organizational pattern for achieving modular and maintainable codebase.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data to achieve persistence.
- **Exception Handling:** Techniques for managing errors and ensuring application stability.

## Conclusion

The Hotel Management System is designed to streamline hotel operations, providing administrators with efficient tools for room and reservation management, and clients with a seamless experience for booking and managing their reservations. The application's user-friendly interface, robust architecture, and comprehensive features make it an ideal solution for modern hotel management needs.
